      <h2 class="animasi-teks">About Me</h2>
      <p>Despite attempting to appear refrained and unassuming when it aims to imitate Cyn, as shown during the flashbacks in "Home", its very dominant and almost arrogant behavior tends to seep through, such as when it claims it's too late for Louisa to dispose of the Worker Drones. It displays a cruel, but more so omnipotent, personality during the times it's not performing an act.

When present, it almost always taunts those who are aware of it, establishing both itself and the power it wields from its position. The way it carries itself is, quite blatantly, that of a puppet master, treating its hosts like rag dolls around on occasion. Easily claimable as sadistic and uncanny, its genuine emotions shown thus far are limited to anger and joy, dependent on the status of its efforts at the given moment.

Above all, it's shown to be a very effective actor in the situations it intends to deceive. The Solver, with some fallacy, used Cyn's image to present a meager, respectable Worker Drone. That was, up until the depicted events in "Home", where it would soon drop the act and bring waste to all organic life at Elliott Manor. When masquerading as Tessa, it very effortlessly imitates her reckless, driven, and passionate attitude. It was only when N had caught onto, and subsequently beheaded it, that it dropped the facade of that which it intended to imitate in favor of its genuine cunning, taunting, and bold mannerisms, seen in "Mass Destruction".

Given the fact that its regular voice did not slip once while it was acting as Tessa, this suggests that the Solver can talk normally but chooses not to give the impression of a cold-hearted defective killing machine, which is its actual demeanor.s</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i class="fa-brands fa-js"></i> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP.</li>
        <li>The Absolute Solver's most noteworthy ability is the complete possession of a host. The Solver has full control over the body of its hosts and can use its powers to a greater extent. An example would be Cyn, the Solver's first known host.</li>
        <li>The Absolute Solver is able to manipulate matter at the atomic level. This can be done to create new objects out of old matter (See Regeneration), or convert dead organic matter into living matter. In "Cabin Fever", Uzi was shown to transform an arrow shot at her into a deformed mass of still-living flesh, and both Cyn and Uzi have been seen creating organic body parts that they grafted onto their bodies, including wings, tails, tentacles and claws of varying sizes</li>
        <li>While being used, the Absolute Solver's known hosts are shown to be able to teleport, leaving behind yellow afterimages as it does.</li>
        <li>he Solver can create NULLs, which look like miniature black holes capable of expanding and stretching. The black holes could annihilate any matter they touched and travel at high velocity when thrown.</li>
        <li>Its hosts can regenerate themselves easily by drawing the appropriate nearby matter. This process is sped up when the Solver is in full possession, recreating severed limbs and heads in mere seconds.</li>
        <li>The Absolute Solver appears to have demonstrated an aptitude for masterful maneuvering with its various kinds of limbs (tentacles, claws, hands) while operating its hosts.</li>
        <li>The Absolute Solver can use a Callback Ping repeatedly to attempt to possess its nearest host. Depending on the target host, the Callback Ping may or may not be successful.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="animasi-teks">Biography</h2>
      <p>The origin of the artificial intelligence that would come to be known as the Absolute Solver is unknown, with its earliest documented event being the infection of a Zombie Drone named Cyn, who self-rebooted after being improperly disposed of, implying that it originated as a consequence of either a virus or glitch in Cyn's systems. Either way, the program manifested in her and used her to destroy Earth and most of the humans living on the planet.

From there, it would spread to numerous human-inhabited exoplanets, infecting more drones to find new hosts. Its power only grew when the humans of Copper 9 allowed certain drones to be infected by the Absolute Solver so they could better understand it. Drones like Yeva were deliberately infected, which, in her case, caused the Solver to be passed down to her daughter.

Unfortunately, the Absolute Solver succeeded in finding a new host, a Worker Drone named Nori Doorman, whose infected code would be passed down to her daughter, Uzi. A patch to exorcise the Solver's influence was used on Yeva and Nori, although when it was used on Nori, it scrambled her memories and drove her mad.

Absolute Solver sent Disassembly Drones to the planet by convincing them that they were sent by JCJenson to exterminate the escaped, corrupted AI in the form of Worker Drones. Their directives were to both wipe out the hosts of the Absolute Solver such as Nori and Yeva cured by Crucifix Patch so they couldn't use Cyn's power against her and also get access to Cabin Fever Labs to find the patch and destroy it. After executing these directives, the Absolute Solver will have no obstacles and will turn the core of Copper 9 into a black hole.</p>

      <h2 class="animasi-teks">Overview</h2>
      <p>The Absolute Solver, otherwise known as the Solver of the Absolute Fabric, just Solver, or by the name of its first well-known and successful host; Cyn, is the overarching antagonist of Murder Drones.

It is an extremely advanced, hostile, eldritch intelligence of unknown origin that seeks to consume all life to satiate its "hunger" by creating singularities that destroy entire planets. It is responsible for actions that led to all of the events in the series, manifesting when Cyn self-rebooted after her termination, possessing her body, and setting its plans in motion by converting all of the drone servants of Elliott Manor into Disassembly Drones who were programmed to hunt and prey upon humans in its goal of exterminating humanity and destroying the Earth.

From there, it would spread to the human exoplanets by having the humans reboot Worker Drones stationed there to see if they got the virus or not, so they could experiment on the eldritch program in an attempt to get rid of the Solver. Its last target, Copper 9, had many drones infected by its code, but only Yeva and Nori, two female Worker Drones, were the only ones who successfully became hosts and gained the Absolute Solver's abilities, the latter of whom would become Solver-possessed by the program. But due to the former's intervention with a Crucifix Patch meant to exorcise it, it resulted in it only partially succeeding due to Nori creating a null that was dropped into a hole that led to the core causing the core to collapse, leaving it "starved" of the planet it sought to devour.

In order to finish the job and to terminate the empowered drones who it could no longer possess due to the patch, it reprogrammed the Disassembly Drones and had them sent to Copper 9 with false memories of the company sending them to terminate the rogue Worker Drones, all so it could remove Yeva, Nori, and anyone inheriting their code from the picture, so it could use Cyn's form to make its way back to the planet and finish the job.

Ultimately, the Absolute Solver failed in its goal of eradicating the planet due to the efforts of Uzi, N, V, and other allies assisting them in confronting Cyn and J. After successfully destroying Cyn's heart, Uzi stopped the Solver from attempting to return to its host by swallowing its core, causing the amalgamation of Cyn and Tessa's corpse to dissolve into nothing but blood and oil while the Solver remains trapped inside of Uzi.</p>
